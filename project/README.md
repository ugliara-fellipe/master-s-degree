## Project

This folder contains; the Cyan programs ([app](https://github.com/ugliara-fellipe/master-s-degree/tree/main/project/app/), which have been developed; the JARs files ([jar](https://github.com/ugliara-fellipe/master-s-degree/tree/main/project/jar/)), which are the Java libraries used; the Cyan libraries ([lib](https://github.com/ugliara-fellipe/master-s-degree/tree/main/project/lib/), which were used and developed; and source code for the Cyan compiler ([proj](https://github.com/ugliara-fellipe/master-s-degree/tree/main/project/proj/)), which was used during this research.

In the folder [app](https://github.com/ugliara-fellipe/master-s-degree/tree/main/project/app/) is explained how to compile and run the Cyan programs available. And in the folder [proj](https://github.com/ugliara-fellipe/master-s-degree/tree/main/project/proj/) is explained how to generate a new Cyan compiler JAR.

On the website [Cyan](http://cyan-lang.org/) other versions of the Cyan compiler are available. If they are used, programs and libraries probably needed to be adapted.
