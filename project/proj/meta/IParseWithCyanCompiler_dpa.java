/**
 * this interface contains method interfaces to parse literal objects  
 * such as <code>{* "one":1, "two":2 *}</code> and <code>@graph{* 1:2, 2:3 *}</code>. The parsing can be made 
 * with the help of the Cyan compiler but the code to be parsed is limited. By "limited" we mean 
 * that the Cyan compiler will only supply to the methods of this interface tokens that are inside the 
 * metaobject annotation. For example, in <code>{* "one":1, "two":2 *}</code> the Cyan compiler will only
 * supply tokens that are between <code>{*</code> and <code>*}</code>.   </p>
