/**
 * this interface contains methods to parse macros.  The methods
 * of this interface can retrieve any number of tokens, using class {@link ICompilerMacro_dpa}, from 
 * the start of the macro call onwards. This method decides when to stop retrieving tokens through
 * method <code>next</code>. This is necessary because there is no token or keyword that ends a macro call. 
 * Only the macro grammar can decide when the call ended. And the macro grammar is implemented by
 * the methods of this interface. 
 *  
 * </p> Other compiler interfaces such as {@link IParseWithCyanCompiler_dpa} are
 * very different in this aspect. They only allow one to retrieve tokens inside a literal object.
 * </p>
