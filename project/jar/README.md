## JARs (Java ARchive)

This folder contains the external JAR files added to the project. They are Java libraries used in the implementation of the Cyan compiler. The added JARs are:

- commons-io: Commons IO is a library of utilities to assist in the development of IO functionality [(Link)](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/);
- commons-lang: auxiliary utilities for the java.lang API, provides string manipulation, basic numerical methods, object reflection, simultaneity, serialization and system properties [(Link)](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/);
- gson: is a Java library that can be used to convert Java objects into their JSON representation [(Link)](https://github.com/google/gson);
- java-json: provides portable APIs that allow you to analyze, generate, transform and query JSON [(Link)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/articles/java/api-java-para-json-2251326-enb.html);
- javassist: providing a means to manipulate the Java bytecode of a Java program. The javassist provides support for structural reflection, that is, the ability to change the implementation of a class at runtime [(Link)](http://jboss-javassist.github.io/javassist/);
- jgraphx: provides functionality to view and interact with graphics [(Link)](https://github.com/jgraph/jgraphx);

- reflections: determine methods and attributes that will be used for a given class at runtime [(Link)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/javareflection-1536171.html);
- saci: Cyan compiler generated by this project [(Link)](http://cyan-lang.org/);
- slf4j: facilitates the creation of logs in Java [(Link)](https://www.slf4j.org/);
- treplica: framework used to develop replicated applications [(Link)](https://bitbucket.org/gdvieira/treplica/src/master/).
