Dear Editor,

\vfill

I am  writing to submit  the paper entitled  ``Transparent Replication
Using Metaprogramming in Cyan'' to the Science of Computer Programming
Journal.

This paper is an expanded and  thoroughly revised version of the paper
with  the same  title published  in  the 21st  Brazilian Symposium  on
Programming Languages in  2017 (doi:10.1145/3125374.3125375). The main
contribution of the paper is showing how to use metaprogramming in the
Cyan  language   to  automatically  generate  code   to  integrate  an
application to a replication framework. We think this paper will be of
interest  to readers  of Science  of Computer  Programming because  it
shows how  the simple  and powerful metaobject  protocol (MOP)  of the
Cyan language can be used to tackle a difficult programming challenge,
creating replicated applications.

Besides corrections  and clarifications, this expanded  version of the
paper adds  a more complete description  of the Cyan MOP,  an expanded
description  of  the replication  framework  used  (Treplica), a  more
detailed description  of the implementation  of the metaobjects  and a
new section about the detection  and removal of non-determinism in the
replicated objects.

Yours sincerely,
